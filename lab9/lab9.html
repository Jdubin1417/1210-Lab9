            <h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
			<p>
				<img class="floatRight" src="images/win.png" alt="Windows logo">
				An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory, processes, and all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="floatLeft" src="images/mac.png" alt="Mac logo">
				Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are many different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.<span class="cite"><a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/2" target="_blank">http://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/2</a></span>

				Many of you are familiar with Windows and Mac. Both of these are examples of operating systems. They differ from application and utility software. Application and utility software work 'on top' of the operating system to perform specific tasks. For example, Microsoft&reg; Word is application software that one uses to create text documents. However, when the user wants to print the document, after clicking the 'Print' icon, or navigating to File &rArr; Print, Word has to ask the Microsoft&reg; Windows operating system to print the file. Word can't access the printer directly.
			</p>
			<p>
				So an operating system acts as the 'director' between a system's hardware and its user software. This serves several purposes, most important of which is to protect the hardware from user's meddling.
			</p>
			    <h2>So what is Linux?</h2>
            <p>
				
				Linux is the best-known and most-used open source ('open source' essentially means 'free' - as opposed to Windows and MacOX, which you have to pay for) operating system. Again, as an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computerâ€™s hardware.

				Some people, particularly members of the Free Software Foundation, refer to this collection as GNU/Linux, because many of the tools included are GNU components. However, not all Linux installations use GNU components as a part of their operating system. Android, for example, uses a Linux kernel but relies very little on GNU tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				Linus Torvalds invented Linux itself. In 1991, Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland where he had been using Minix, a non-free Unix-like system, and began writing his own kernel. He started by developing device drivers and hard-drive access, and by September had a basic design that he called Version 0.01. This kernel, which is called Linux, was afterwards combined with the GNU system to produce a complete free operating system.<span class="cite"><a href="http://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_gnulinux.htm" target="_blank">http://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_gnulinux.htm</a></span>
			</p>
			<p class="clearBoth">
				<img class="floatRight" src="images/003.png" alt="Debian Linux Logo">
				Modern Linux is available in a large (200+) number of distributions, or 'distros.' Many are fine-tuned for special uses, such as education, servers, mathematics, scientific applications, and, perhaps most popular, desktop applications. You can do almost anything using Linux that you can do on a proprietary (i.e., Windows or Mac) operating system: office applications - word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, photo editing, web browsing, video and audio editing, games, software development (Linux supports modern languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java). Most of the world's web servers are Linux-based (Apache2 and Nginx). Anyone who uses an Android-based smartphone is already using Linux (often without even being aware of it!). Almost all of the embedded computing (car computers, for example) world (the Internet of Things) is also Linux-based.
			</p>
            <h2>So what does it mean to me?</h2>
			<p>
				<img class="floatLeft" src="images/004.png" alt="Ubuntu Linux Logo">
				As Linux continues to grow and gain popularity in the computing world, the chances you'll eventually have to work with it also increase. Familiarity with the Linux operating system can lead to employment opportunities, as many enterprises have begun to consider that the return on investment (ROI) associated with using open source software is greater than that offered by using proprietary software. In other words, it is more cost-effective to use free and open source (F.O.S.S.) software, which can be updated at need, free of charge, and which enjoys a large public support base, instead of proprietary software, which claims 'better' support, but often includes additional licensing fees. Another argument in favor of F.O.S.S. software is that it is more stable and secure by virtue of the thousands of developers who actively contribute to it, versus the much smaller number of contributers associated with proprietary software.
			</p>
			<p>
				The debate goes on, but it is interesting to note that the big software shops, including Microsoft, are now beginning to make use of open source software in their projects.
